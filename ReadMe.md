# Installation
1. Download the latest version: [Download](https://github.com/No-Deadlines/UPaint-Standalone/raw/master/UPaint%20Standalone%201.1.1.zip)
2. Unzip and place wherever you want.
    * **NB:** If you already have a version of UPaint Standalone installed, it is recommended to keep the same location and replace it (delete old files, add new ones).
4. (Optional) To add the Windows context menu extension (right clicking on a png or jpg file will now display a "Edit with UPaint" option), run **as administrator** the <ins>Context Menu Install.bat</ins> file. Windows might warn you about security risks, you can "Run anyway". If you are concerned about the risks, you can read the file contents in a text editor.
    * **NB:** If you move the install location of UPaint Standalone (picked at step 2), you will need to re-run the <ins>Context Menu Install.bat</ins> to repair this feature.
    * **NB:** If you want to remove the context menu extension, run **as administrator** the <ins>Context Menu Uninstall.bat</ins> file.
